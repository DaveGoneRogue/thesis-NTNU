  abstract = {We examine Fourier frames and, more generally, frame measures for different probability measures. We prove that if a measure has an associated frame measure, then it must have a certain uniformity in the sense that the weight is distributed quite uniformly on its support. To be more precise, by considering certain absolute continuity properties of the measure and its translation, we recover the characterization on absolutely continuous measures g dx with Fourier frames obtained in [24]. Moreover, we prove that the frame bounds are pushed away by the essential infimum and supremum of the function g. This also shows that absolutely continuous spectral measures supported on a set {$\Omega$}, if they exist, must be the standard Lebesgue measure on {$\Omega$} up to a multiplicative constant. We then investigate affine iterated function systems (IFSs), we show that if an IFS with no overlap admits a frame measure then the probability weights are all equal. Moreover, we also show that the \L aba\textendash Wang conjecture [20] is true if the self-similar measure is absolutely continuous. Finally, we will present a new approach to the conjecture of Liu and Wang [29] about the structure of non-uniform Gabor orthonormal bases of the form G(g, {$\Lambda$}, J ).},

  abstract = {In his paper Theory of Communication [Gab46], D. Gabor proposed the use of a family of functions obtained from one Gaussian by time-and frequency shifts. Each of these is well concentrated in time and frequency; together they are meant to constitute a complete collection of building blocks into which more complicated time-depending functions can be decomposed. The application to communication proposed by Gabor was to send the coeffi cients of the decomposition into this family of a signal, rather than the signal itself. This remained a proposal-as far as I know there were no seri ous attempts to implement it for communication purposes in practice, and in fact, at the critical time-frequency density proposed originally, there is a mathematical obstruction; as was understood later, the family of shifted and modulated Gaussians spans the space of square integrable functions [BBGK71, Per71] (it even has one function to spare [BGZ75] ...) but it does not constitute what we now call a frame, leading to numerical insta bilities. The Balian-Low theorem (about which the reader can find more in some of the contributions in this book) and its extensions showed that a similar mishap occurs if the Gaussian is replaced by any other function that is "reasonably" smooth and localized. One is thus led naturally to considering a higher time-frequency density},

We shall consider the exponential functions \$ e\_\{\textbackslash lambda\} \$ on \$ \textbackslash Omega \$ given by \$ e\_\{\textbackslash lambda\}(x)=e\^\{i2\textbackslash pi\textbackslash lambda x\} \$. If these functions form an orthogonal basis for \$ \textbackslash mathcal\{L\}\^\{2\}(\textbackslash Omega) \$, when \$ \textbackslash lambda \$ ranges over some subset \$ \textbackslash Lambda \$ in \$ R\^d \$, then we say that \$ (\textbackslash Omega,\textbackslash Lambda) \$ is a spectral pair, and that \$ \textbackslash Lambda \$ is a spectrum. We conjecture that \$ (\textbackslash Omega,\textbackslash Lambda) \$ is a spectral pair if and only if the translates of some set \$ \textbackslash Omega' \$ by the vectors of \$ \textbackslash Lambda \$ tile \$ R\^d \$. In the special case of \$ \textbackslash Omega=I\^d \$, the \$ d \$-dimensional unit cube, we prove this conjecture, with \$ \textbackslash Omega'=I\^d \$, for \$ d \textbackslash leq 3 \$, describing all the tilings by \$ I\^d \$, and for all \$ d \$ when \$ \textbackslash Lambda \$ is a discrete periodic set.
