\begin{document}
Please see the \verb|commmands.tex| file. There are not many outside of the ones used for math. The ones worth mentioning are the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item {\verb|\mycomment|}  A "block comment" in the sense that it removes the text from being printed to the final file. However, the counters for figures, chapters, equations, etc. will still increase as they were in the text.
    \item {\verb|\SigridComment|}  Named after the author's supervisor Sigrid, one simple way of placing comments in the text. Produces the following: \SigridComment{Blablablabla}
    \item {\verb|\SigridChange|}  Named after the author's supervisor Sigrid, one simple way of highlighting changes made in the text. Produces the following: \SigridChange{Blablablabla}
    \item {\verb|\SigridChangeTwo|}  Alternate highlight color for changes made in the text. Produces the following: \SigridChangeTwo{Blablablabla}
\end{itemize}
